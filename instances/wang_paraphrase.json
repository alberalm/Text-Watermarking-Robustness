A new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released on Tuesday found Sanders leading Donald Trump among likely Michigan voters by just one point, 49 percent to 48 percent. Thats a significant drop from last month, when Sanders was ahead by six points.\n\nSanderss lead comes despite the fact that he hasnt held a public event in Michigan since September. The Vermont senator has spent much of the campaign focused on his home state of New Hampshire, where polls show him trailing both Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush.\n\nMeanwhile, Trumps support among Michigan voters has remained steady over the past few months. He remains popular with white working-class voters, who make up more than two-thirds of the states electorate. And he still enjoys strong support among African-Americans, who account for nearly half of the states Democratic primary voters.\n\nTrumps support among white working-class voters is particularly noteworthy because it suggests that he may have difficulty reaching out to black voters", "paraphrase": "\nThe presidential nomination race for the Republican and Democratic parties heats up this week in Michigan, as candidates vie for a critical election. With the ongoing water crisis in Flint and Detroit's recent bankruptcy, voters might be inclined to support a non-establishment candidate, which could benefit Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro (D).\nHowever, new polling data suggests a tightening of the race. According to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Tuesday, Sanders leads Donald Trump among likely Michigan voters by a slim margin of 49% to 48%. This represents a significant decrease from last month, when Sanders held a six-point lead.\nSanders' lead can be attributed to his strong performance among white working-class voters, despite the fact that he has largely focused his campaign efforts on New Hampshire. On the other hand, Trump has maintained steady support among Michigan voters, particularly among white working-class voters, who make up the majority of the state's electorate. Additionally, he continues to enjoy strong backing from African-American voters, who account for nearly half of the Democratic primary electorate.\nTrump's ability to appeal to both white working-class and African-American voters could be a challenge for him in the general election."}

However, the Trump administration has proposed cutting $6.7 billion from the UN's $5.8 billion budget for 2018, which would significantly affect the organization's peacekeeping operations. The United States contributes about $3.4 billion per year to these operations, which have been impacted by conflicts in recent years, such as the Syrian civil war.\nGuterres emphasized the importance of multilateralism and global cooperation, stating, \"It's an insolvable problem if we don't find a way to work together.\" He acknowledged the challenge of persuading Trump to change his mind but expressed determination to convince the American people of the value of UN funding.\nA senior State Department official also spoke at the news conference, highlighting the administration's stance on the matter. The official noted that the cuts were part of a broader effort to reassess US foreign aid priorities and promote more efficient use of resources.

For example, if you weigh 150 pounds and have a BMI of 25, you will require about 2,500 calories", "paraphrase": "\nTo determine your daily calorie needs for muscle growth, a straightforward approach involves calculating your basal metabolic rate (BMR) based on your weight, age, height, and gender. Then, you can factor in an energy surplus to account for the additional calories required for muscle growth.\nLet's begin by examining some fundamental metrics:\nWeight (kg)\n\nBody Mass Index (BMI)\n\nAge (years)\n\nHeight (inches)\n\nWeight (lbs)\n\nCalories Per Day (kcal/day)\n\nTotal Fat (g)\n\nCarbohydrates (g)\n\nDietary Fiber (g)\n\nSugars (g)\n\nProtein (g)\n\nVitamin B12 (mcg)\n\nIron (mg)\n\nCalcium (mg)\n\nMagnesium (mg)\n\nFolate (mcg)\n\nZinc (mg)\n\nPotassium (mg)\n\nNow, let's calculate your daily calorie needs: divide your weight in kilograms by your height in inches. For instance, if you weigh 150 pounds and have a BMI of 25, you will require around 2,500 calories.\nHowever, this is just your basal metabolic rate, and you'll need to consume additional calories to support muscle growth. A general rule of thumb is to consume an additional 250-500 calories per day above your BMR to promote muscle growth.\nSo, in this example, you would aim for approximately 2,750-3,000 calories per day to support muscle growth.\nRemember, these are general guidelines, and your individual calorie needs may vary depending on your specific goals and circumstances. It's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian to determine the best calorie intake for your unique needs."}
