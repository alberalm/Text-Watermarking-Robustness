However, there are other Islamic militant organizations in Pakistan that oppose the Taliban. Similarly, in Afghanistan, many terrorist organizations oppose the Taliban, yet all Islamic groups in both countries are united in their adherence to Islam. The main source of discord within Islam is due to disagreements over whether one group has betrayed their Muslim brethren by either."}

According to the Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA), it may take over two decades for gender rights to be fully realized.\nWhile there have been notable advancements in workplace equality, the journey towards true parity remains elusive. Positive developments include more equal and fair workplaces, but significant reforms are still required to overcome the lingering glass ceiling. The notion that this is the millennials' fight has been espoused, but the reality is that gender inequality is an enduring issue that affects all genders.\nReshma Saujani, in her book Bold, highlights the notion that for women, there is no finish line. This statement extends beyond work-life balance and speaks to the very essence of the fight for gender equality. It is a constant, ongoing struggle that demands persistence and determination.\nIn conclusion, while progress has been made, the fight for gender equality is far from over. It is a complex, insidious issue that requires ongoing attention and effort to overcome. By acknowledging the reality of the situation and remaining committed to the cause, we can work towards a more equitable future for all genders."}

This amounts to around 1 in 8 of the government's spending going towards supporting businesses, as revealed by a report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Moreover, the study found that individuals contribute only 33% of national earnings in taxes, the lowest among 33 OECD member countries. This is largely due to the growing number of self-employed individuals who have to pay income tax on all their earnings, whereas corporations only pay taxes on their profits above 300,000 pounds. The comparison between the contributions from self-employed individuals and employed workers to the UK Treasury is striking, with the former paying significantly more in taxes."}
