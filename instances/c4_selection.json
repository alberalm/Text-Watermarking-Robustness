Holder, 14 states have introduced new voting restrictions in this election, and this represents only a sliver of the seismic crisis facing our democracy in this presidential race. Some estimates anticipate that roughly 1.3 million voters in vital swing states could be disenfranchised because of these new voting restrictions.\nAdditionally, more than 6 million Americans will be barred from voting due to felony convictions, and 2.2 million of those are African American. This amounts to 1 out of every 13 African Americans of voting age being barred from the ballot box.

For Bush, a lifetime of channeling his energy has led to stylistic innovations that have changed the course of bluegrass and roots music alike. But instead of kicking back and soaking up honors such as an Americana Music Association Lifetime Achievement Award and suite of Grammys and International Bluegrass Music Association trophies, Bush strives relentlessly to create something new. A rapt merging of life and art fills the legendary mandolin player's new album Storyman, a freewheeling collection that gleefully picks and chooses from jazz, folk, blues, reggae, country swing, and bluegrass to create a jubilant noise only classifiable as the Sam Bush sound.\nSam Bush will return to the historic Stoughton Opera House for another unforgettable performance on Thursday, March 14.\n\"With this band I have now I am free to try anything.
