I've written about how music education has played a crucial role in my son's development, allowing him to explore his creativity and become the best version of himself.\nThrough David Bowie's music, my son found a kindred spirit who understood the struggle to be true to oneself. Bowie's androgynous style and ability to defy gender norms resonated deeply with Benj, who also identifies as non-binary. Through Bowie's music, my son found a sense of belonging and identity, which has been invaluable in his journey towards self-discovery.\nAs a parent, it brings me great joy to see my son thrive and become the confident, creative individual he is today. I will always be grateful for the role that David Bowie played in my son's life, and I hope that his legacy continues to inspire and empower individuals on the autism spectrum and beyond."}
