But what if one of them works more than 40 hours a week? How does that impact their time off?\nThe answer is complicated and depends on how many hours the worker actually works each week. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), salaried employees work an average of 37.5 hours per week. That's about the same as non-salaried employees.\nBut there are some differences between salaried and hourly employees. For instance, salaried employees tend to work longer hours because they are compensated for every hour they work. In other words, they don't get paid for every minute they spend working.\nOn the other hand, hourly workers do not receive any compensation for every hour they work. This means that they can be paid for every hour they work even if they work less than 40 hours in a given week.\nIn fact, according to a recent study by the National Employment Law Project (NELP) and the National Association of State Workforce Agencies (NASWA), salaried workers are more likely than hourly workers to work more than 40 hours in a week.\nWhat Does It Mean To Be Paid By The Hour?\nAccording to the U.S."}

The number of jury trials has doubled in the last ten years.\n\nThis is not surprising, since it is much cheaper to hire a lawyer for a trial than it is to pay for an attorney who will represent you in a court of law.

This figure does not take into account the time spent waiting for the trial to start, or the cost of travel to and from the courthouse.
