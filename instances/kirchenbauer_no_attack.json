The best treatments for melanoma are typically surgery and radiation therapy, but they are expensive and only work for a few patients.\nA group of researchers at the University of Washington in Seattle have developed a new compound that may soon be developed into an effective treatment for melanoma. The compound, called MAL-1, blocks the activity of a protein called melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R), a protein that helps the skin's melanocytes produce melanin, a pigment that helps protect the skin from the sun. The researchers say the compound could be effective in the treatment of a wide range of skin cancers, including basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and basal cell carcinoma-in-situ.\n\"We have developed a new melanocortin-4 receptor inhibitor that has the potential to treat a large number of skin cancers and is safe and well tolerated,\" said the study's senior author, Jihong Li, assistant professor in the School of Medicine and the School of Public Health. \"We are now conducting further"}
